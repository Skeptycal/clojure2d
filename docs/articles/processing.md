# Comparison to Processing

Below you can find comparison Processing functions with Clojure2d.

Assuming that following variables are defined:

- `window` - display created with [[show-window]]
- `cnvs` - canvas created with [[canvas]] inside drawing context (see [[with-canvas->]] or [[with-canvas]])

And following namespaces are loaded:

```clojure
(:require [clojure2d.core :refer :all] ;; generaral Clojure2d functions
          [clojure2d.pixels :as p] ;; pixels operations
          [clojure2d.color :as c] ;; color operations
          [fastmath.core :as m] ;; general math functions
          [fastmath.random :as r]) ;; random and noise
```
